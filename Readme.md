crafted with precision by Facebook, that aims to simplify the intricate process of building interactive user interfaces. It was created by Jordan Walke one of Facebook's software engineers at Facebook inital release May 29, 2013.

React takes a different approach by letting to build what's known as SPA(single page application). A SPA loads only a single HTML document on first request. Then it updates the specific portion, content or body of the webpage that needs updating using JavaScript.

React relies on a virtual DOM, which is a copy of the actual DOM. Its virtual DOM is immediately reloaded to reflect this new change whenever there is a change in the data state.
